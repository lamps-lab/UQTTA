    Modified from `torchvision/ops/boxes.py#L39
    <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/
    505cd6957711af790211896d32b40291bea1bc21/torchvision/ops/boxes.py#L39>`_.
    In order to perform NMS independently per class, we add an offset to all
    the boxes. The offset is dependent only on the class idx, and is large
    enough so that boxes from different classes do not overlap.

    Note:
        In v1.4.1 and later, ``batched_nms`` supports skipping the NMS and
        returns sorted raw results when `nms_cfg` is None.

    Args:
        boxes (torch.Tensor): boxes in shape (N, 4) or (N, 5).
        scores (torch.Tensor): scores in shape (N, ).
        idxs (torch.Tensor): each index value correspond to a bbox cluster,
            and NMS will not be applied between elements of different idxs,
            shape (N, ).
        nms_cfg (dict | optional): Supports skipping the nms when `nms_cfg`
            is None, otherwise it should specify nms type and other
            parameters like `iou_thr`. Possible keys includes the following.

            - iou_threshold (float): IoU threshold used for NMS.
            - split_thr (float): threshold number of boxes. In some cases the
              number of boxes is large (e.g., 200k). To avoid OOM during
              training, the users could set `split_thr` to a small value.
              If the number of boxes is greater than the threshold, it will
              perform NMS on each group of boxes separately and sequentially.
              Defaults to 10000.
        class_agnostic (bool): if true, nms is class agnostic,
            i.e. IoU thresholding happens over all boxes,
            regardless of the predicted class. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        tuple: kept dets and indice.

        - boxes (Tensor): Bboxes with score after nms, has shape
          (num_bboxes, 5). last dimension 5 arrange as
          (x1, y1, x2, y2, score)
        - keep (Tensor): The indices of remaining boxes in input
          boxes.
